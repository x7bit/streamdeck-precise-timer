# Precise Timer

The `Precise Timer` is a Javascript plugin for [Stream Deck](https://developer.elgato.com/documentation/stream-deck/).

`Precise Timer` requires Stream Deck 4.1 or later.

# Description

Precise and pauseable timer, especially suitable for long periods. Since the default timer (from the "Stream Deck" category) is quite inaccurate for long periods, the `Precise Timer` plugin was developed with the idea of configuring and measuring the time of a workday and not to work more than necessary. To do this, the plugin saves the system time when the timer starts, and calculates the difference. This ensures that the measurement is accurate even when the timer is set to many hours.

## Features:

- Pauseable: press the key to pause/resume it
- Resettable: press the key for more than 2 seconds to reset it
- Configurable: you can configure hours, minutes and seconds in the *Property Inspector*
